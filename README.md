# Animal recognition for self driving cars

VisionTech Solutions wants to develop an automatic image recognition system to distinguish between vehicles and animals. The goal is to optimize wildlife monitoring operations in urban areas, preventing road accidents and protecting both animals and vehicles.

VisionTech Solutions is collaborating with municipal administrations to implement a real-time monitoring system in cities, using cameras installed along roads to identify and classify vehicles and animals. This system will help prevent road accidents caused by sudden animal crossings by alerting drivers through electronic road signs.
